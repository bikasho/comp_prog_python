    "**Finger exercise**: In a vacuum, the speed of a falling object is defined by the equation `v = v0 + gt`, where `v0` is the initial velocity of the object, `t` is the number of seconds the object has been falling, and `g` is the gravitational constant, roughly `9.8 m/sec2` on the surface of the Earth and `3.711 m/ sec2` on Mars. A scientist measures the velocity of a falling object on an unknown planet. She does this by measuring the downward velocity of an object at different points in time. At `time 0`, the object has an unknown velocity of `v0`. Implement a function that fits a model to the time and velocity data and estimates `g` for that planet and `v0` for the experiment. It should return its estimates for `g` and `v0`, and also r-squared for the model."
