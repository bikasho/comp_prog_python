    "**Finger exercise**: You are wandering through a forest and see a field of delicious-looking mushrooms. You fill your basket with them, and head home prepared to cook them up and serve them to your husband. Before you cook them, however, he demands that you consult a book about local mushroom species to check whether they are poisonous. The book says that 80% of the mushrooms in the local forest are poisonous. However, you compare your mushrooms to the ones pictured in the book, and decide that you are 95% certain that your mushrooms are safe. How comfortable should you be about serving them to your husband (assuming that you would rather not become a widow)?"
